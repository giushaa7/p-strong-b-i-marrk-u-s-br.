      <b>Lorem Ipsum </b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
      industry. <br />
      <br />
      <b>Lorem Ipsum</b>has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since
      the <mark>1500s,</mark> when an unknown printer took a galley of type
      <br />
      <br />
      and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
      five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
      essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <mark>1960s </mark> with
      the release <br />
      of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with
      desktop publishing software like
      <del><b>Aldus PageMaker</b></del> including versions of Lorem Ipsum
